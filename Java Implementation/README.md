# min2phase
- Rubik's Cube solver or scrambler. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cs0x7f/min2phase.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cs0x7f/min2phase)



# two-phase algorithm
- See Kociemba's [page](http://kociemba.org/cube.htm)

## Improvements comparing to conventional two-phase algorithm
Conventional two-phase algorithm only find (sub-)optimal solutions to &lt;U,R2,F2,D,L2,B2&gt;. However, If we are able to find more phase1 solutions within a limited depth, the probability of finding a short solution will be increased. 
- Try different axes: The target of phase1 can be either &lt;U,R2,F2,D,L2,B2&gt;, &lt;U2,R,F2,D2,L,B2&gt;, or &lt;U2,R2,F,D2,L2,B&gt;.
- Try the inverse of the state: We will try to solve the inverse state simultaneously to find more phase1 solutions. 
- Try pre-scramble: We can also use pre-scramble technique (which is widely used in fewest-move challenge) to find more phase1 solutions.

# Benchmark
- Memory: ~1M with twist-flip-pruning (TFP) table, ~0.7M without TFP table, ~40M with Full table. See [Search.java line 28](https://github.com/cs0x7f/min2phase/blob/master/Search.java#L28).
- Average solving time (CPU: Intel Core i7-2670QM. Flag: F=Full P1 table, T=TFP table, A=three axes, I=inverse, P=pre-scramble. Kociemba: Kociemba's [twophase.jar](http://kociemba.org/twophase.jar)):
